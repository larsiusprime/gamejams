Procedural Death Larsrynth
========

So this is the beginnings of a simple PDL game, kind of a cheap clone of the Binding of Isaac.

Look at the source code to get a good idea of how to get started making games in flixel. 

1. Follow [These steps](http://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/) and get "Hello World" working
2. checkout this repository, or just download the contents to your computer
3. Should work in flash/neko/cpp(mac/win/linux) targets
4. (On Windows) : Open the PDL.hxproj file in FlashDevelop, then hit Ctrl+Enter to compile/run

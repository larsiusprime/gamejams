#Procedural Death Jam No. 1
Right now all I've got is the beginnings of my PDJ "entry."
I put quotes around that since, as an organizer, I'm technically not eligible for any awards (conflict of interest). Still, it's fun to make something, and this can perhaps serve as a template for anyone who wants to use it as a starting point, or a good tutorial for making stuff in HaxeFlixel.
